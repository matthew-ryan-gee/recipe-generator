Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce heat and simmer gently until potatoes are tender on the outside but still very firm in the center, 10–12 minutes. Drain potatoes; transfer to a rimmed baking sheet and chill until cool, at least 1 hour. (Fully cooling the potatoes prevents them from getting gummy.)Step 2Grate potatoes on the large holes of a box grater or with a food processor fitted with the grater attachment. (Alternatively, you can use a mandoline fitted with a julienne slicer to create ₁⁄₁₆"" matchsticks.) Transfer grated potatoes to a large bowl and toss with 2 oz. grated Parmesan, 1½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1 tsp. Morton kosher salt, and 2 tsp. pepper.Step 3Heat 3 Tbsp. oil in a medium nonstick or cast-iron skillet over medium. Add potato mixture and, using a heatproof rubber spatula, spread out in an even layer, pressing down on to ensure potatoes make good contact with pan. Cook, occasionally pressing down on potatoes and running spatula around edges and bottom of pan to prevent sticking, until underside is evenly golden brown and crisp, 7–9 minutes. Remove from heat.Step 4Set a large plate upside down over pan. In one swift and confident motion, flip pan and plate to invert rösti onto plate. Set pan back over medium heat, add remaining 1 Tbsp. oil, and carefully slide in rösti, crispy side up. Using spatula, tuck edges into pan to create a neat disk. Cook until second side is golden brown, 5–7 minutes. Run spatula around edges of rösti and give pan a shake until you can feel rösti freely move around in pan. Carefully slide rösti onto a platter and top with more Parmesan and pepper. Slice into wedges to serve.Do ahead: Potatoes can be boiled 1 day ahead. Let cool; cover and chill. Rösti (without additional cheese) can be made 3 hours ahead; store uncovered at room temperature. Reheat in a 300° oven 10 minutes before serving."

"One-Pan Chicken Thighs with Burst Tomatoes, Harissa, and Feta",https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/one-pan-chicken-thighs-with-burst-tomatoes-harissa-and-feta,Molly Baz,"Ingredients4 servings6skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs (about 2¼ lb. total)3tsp. kosher salt, divided1½lb. cherry tomatoes (any color)¼cup harissa paste3Tbsp. red wine vinegar3sprigs oregano, divided4oz. fetaCrusty bread (for serving)","PreparationStep 1Pat 6 chicken thighs dry with paper towels. This will help the skin get nice and brown. Season all over with 2½ tsp. salt. (When you're seasoning meat, a good rule of thumb is 1 tsp. salt per pound.)Step 2Place chicken (skin side down) in a dry large cast-iron skillet with the heat off. Heat over medium and cook chicken, undisturbed, until skin is very crisp and deeply golden brown and releases from pan (an indication that the skin is brown and crackly), 13–16 minutes. You have permission to rotate the pan (but not the chicken) from time to time to encourage all thighs to get equal love from the burner. And just like starting fish skin side down in a room temp pan guarantees crackly, bronzed skin, doing the same with chicken renders the fat slowly—and that means even browning and the crispiest skin imaginable.Step 3Using tongs, transfer chicken to a plate. Make sure to keep it skin side up: Placing that crispy skin against the plate will cause it to steam and sog, negating all of your hard work.Step 4Add 1½ lb. cherry tomatoes, ¼ cup harissa paste, 3 Tbsp. red wine vinegar, 1 oregano sprig  and remaining ½ tsp. salt to pan. Increase heat to medium-high and cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes have burst and released all of their juices, and the juices have started to thicken, 8–10 minutes.Step 5Nestle chicken thighs back into skillet (keep the skin side up) over tomatoes.Step 6Reduce heat to medium-low, bring to a simmer, and cook until chicken is just cooked through and flesh is no longer pink (an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part near the bone will register 165°), and tomato sauce has thickened and a wooden spoon leaves a trail when dragged through, 6–8 minutes. Let sit 5 minutes—this gives the meat an opportunity to reabsorb the moisture that moved to the surface while it cooked. Sounds technical, but it means your chicken will be tender and juicy.Step 7While chicken cooks, cut 4 oz. feta into ¼""-thick planks.Step 8Once chicken has rested for 5 minutes, break feta planks into large pieces, scattering over skillet. Some pieces will stay intact while others will soften into the sauce a little—and that's exactly what you want.Step 9Pick leaves off remaining 2 oregano sprigs and scatter over chicken and tomatoes.Step 10Serve with torn crusty bread for sopping up any extra tomato sauce."

Slow-Roast Gochujang Chicken,https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/slow-roast-gochujang-chicken,Molly Baz,"Ingredients4 servings13½–4-lb. whole chicken1Tbsp. Diamond Crystal or 1¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt, plus moreFreshly ground black pepper5Tbsp. gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)¼cup plus 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil2heads of garlic1½"" piece fresh ginger1½lb. baby Yukon Gold potatoes (about 1½"" in diameter)5scallions2limes2tsp. honey","Steps1.Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 300°. This is an important temperature for this recipe, so if you don’t have an oven thermometer already, now is the time to get one! Pat chicken dry with paper towels. Place on a small rimmed baking sheet. Season 1 3½–4-lb. whole chicken all over with 1 Tbsp. Diamond Crystal or 1¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt and lots of freshly ground black pepper, making sure to season the inside cavity.2.Whisk 5 Tbsp. gochujang and ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil in a medium bowl until combined. Finely grate 3 garlic cloves (from one of the heads of garlic) into gochujang oil. Peel  1 ½"" piece fresh ginger (a spoon can get the job done), then grate into gochujang oil; whisk to combine.Play/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPauseChevronChevron3.Cut what’s left of the head of garlic in half crosswise. Repeat with second head of garlic. Stuff 2 garlic halves inside cavity of chicken. Tie legs together with kitchen twine.4.Using a pastry brush, brush half of gochujang oil over chicken.5.Toss 1½ lb. baby Yukon Gold potatoes and remaining 2 garlic halves and 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil in remaining gochujang oil until well coated. Season lightly with salt and pepper and toss again to combine.6.Arrange potatoes in a 12"" cast-iron skillet, scooting them toward edges of pan to make space for chicken. Nestle garlic halves (cut sides down) in center of skillet. Place chicken over garlic—as it roasts, it will infuse the fat (and thus, the potatoes) with flavor. If any potatoes have shimmied their way under the chicken, use tongs to arrange them around it (they won’t cook at the same rate if they’re under the chicken).7.Roast chicken and potatoes, turning potatoes once or twice to coat in juices and oil that accumulate in pan, until potatoes are very tender when pressed with the back of a spoon, and chicken skin is deep reddish-golden brown in color, 2½–3 hours. When you wiggle the legs of the chicken, they should feel loose in the joints, meaning the meat is fall-apart tender. Transfer chicken to a cutting board and let rest 10–15 minutes. Don't skip this step: Letting the bird rests helps the juices in the meat to settle (in other words, it makes the meat juicier).8.Meanwhile, use the back of a large spoon or a potato masher to gently smash potatoes in skillet, exposing some of their flesh to juices underneath so they can soak them up.9.Finish the potatoes: Thinly slice 5 scallions on a long diagonal. Cut 2 limes in half. Cut 1 half into wedges and set aside. Stir 2 tsp. honey and juice of remaining lime half into potatoes. Taste potatoes and season with more salt if needed. Scatter sliced scallions over potatoes.Play/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPausePlay/Pause ButtonPauseChevronChevron10.Carve chicken, then arrange pieces over potatoes and scallions. Serve right out of skillet with remaining lime wedges alongside for squeezing, and squeeze out the sweet, slow-roasted garlic cloves as you wish.→  Nervous about carving the bird? This video should help.11.Do Ahead: Chicken can be seasoned 12 hours ahead. Chill chicken if you’re not going to cook within 2 hours of seasoning."
